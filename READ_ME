This projects wanted to assess the ability of neural networks to recognise connected shapes in two dimensions.
It was inspired by a proof in the popular book 'Perceptron' by Minsky and Papert, that showed that a singke perceptron can not solve this task.
The proof is somehow abstract and I wanted to picture geometrically what was going on, therefore I produce a 'brute force' geometric proof using the simplest possible case of a 1x4 tile.
The file 'Conn_proofs' (ITALIAN) contains a sketch of this proof and also a comment on the D-dimensional XOR problem.
Finally, the project was to train a NN with one hidden layer that was able to complete the task and beat the Perceptron.
Since the motivation was merely theoretical I restricted to the case of connected shapes in a 7x7 pixels square (1s and 0s).
The training set (for supervised learning) is generated in the code 'conngen.f90' (Fortran).
The NN is implemented in the file 'connect2.f90' (Fortran) and is written from skratch by myself.
